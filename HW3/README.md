# Week 3

## Monday

### Test Heads Up
Linked list - downfall - not contiguously stored!

- queue - FIFO - First In First Out

#### Question
- Could you have a double linked list with a dictionary that points to the middle, and has threasholds that it could then add pointers to other half of halves?
- With a Dlink list, with a swap operation is it cheaper to update the pointers or the value(s)? Maybe the values until the values become too heavy?
- queue - FIFO

## Wednesday

### Flow
gcc --> LinkedList.h + LinkedList.c --> Compile --> linkedlist.so --> LinkedListInterface.py --> now it can be imported and used
